# BotW Save Editor GUI
This is the GUI for the BotW Save Editor written in C++ and Qt.

# How to use:
1.  Download the Console 1.1 or newer version.
2.  Drag your "\[game_data/caption/option\].sav" onto "Simple Save Editor.exe" and let it work for a moment.
3.  Then drag all save files in the same directory how the GUI.
3.  Open the GUI and edit what you want.
4.  Click on the Save button.
5.  Save and drag the JSON onto the EXE again.
6.  Have fun with the newly created save file!

In case you encounter any problems with the GUI, please notify me via Discord, you can find me on the BotW Modding Discord (Mika#1257).
